#Coding Challengs

Here is a collection of my solutions to various coding challenges. To avoid any copyright issues, I will post only my work, with a short description of their function.

Solutions written in Ruby.

##Codility

I really like the problems and interface Codility uses. The problems tend to be more in-depth, with many test cases to consider. They also always enforce finding the most efficient solution, speed-wise and memory-wise.

TODO: Add my solutions from hard drive

##[code eval](https://www.codeeval.com/)

These tend to be algorithmic problems. The input, usually not shown, is given in the form of a text file. Output is read through console logs (such as using `puts`).

Curretnly top 10% of all Ruby members!

###Hard

 - _[PARTIALLY SOLVED (97.5%)](/code_eval/string_search.rb)_ Find given substring within given string, without using built-in substr
 - _PARTIALLY SOLVED (37.5%)_ Get all permutations of given string
 - _PARTIALLY SOLVED (90%)_ Evaluate prefix expressions
 - _PARTIALLY SOLVED (40%)_ Find longest common subsequence

###Moderate

 - _PARTIALLY SOLVED (75%)_ Determine if given string is a valid email address
 - _PARTIALLY SOLVED (65%) Determine is all absolute differences between successive elements of a sequence include all values 1 to (`n` - 1)
 - _SOLVED_ Count number of ways an array of integers sums to 0
 - _SOLVED_ Continually reverse a number and add to itself until palindrome (without string conversion)
 - _SOLVED_ Find missing letters of an alphabet in a string
 - _SOLVED_ Find pairs of numbers from array that sum to `x`
 - _SOLVED_ Determine if given word is the last word of given string (without `String#index`/`include?`)
 - _SOLVED_ Count the number of `1` bits in `n`
 - _SOLVED_ Delete characters from string
 - _SOLVED_ Find first non-repeated character in string
 - _SOLVED_ Determine the `n` to last element of a list
 - _SOLVED_ Detect loops in a sequence
 - _SOLVED_ Return the `n` longest strings from a set of strings


###Easy

These are _very_ simple problems

 - _SOLVED_ Find penultimate word in a string
 - _SOLVED_ Determine if `n` is an armstrtong number
 - _SOLVED_ Find `n mod m` without built-in `%`
 - _SOLVED_ Determine if each digit of `n` corresponds to the number of `index` digit found in `n`
 - _SOLVED_ Determine if `n` is a happy number
 - _SOLVED_ Find index of last ocurrence of given character in given string
