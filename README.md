#Coding Challengs

Here is a collection of my solutions to various coding challenges. To avoid any copyright issues, I will post only my work, with a short description of their function.

Solutions written in Ruby.

##[Codility](https://codility.com/train/)

I really like the problems and interface Codility uses. The problems tend to be more in-depth, with many test cases to consider. They also always enforce finding the most efficient solution, speed-wise and memory-wise.

TODO: Add my solutions from hard drive

##[code eval](https://www.codeeval.com/)

These tend to be algorithmic problems. The input, usually not shown, is given in the form of a text file. Output is read through console logs (such as using `puts`).

Currently top 10% of all Ruby members!
